daily art code
This is my repository for daily code experiments.  

I try to follow one principle: All code in a given project must be written in one day. 

I don't always hold to the principle but I start each project from blank scratch and I try to spend less than 24 hours before moving on.

This forces me to develop new ways of attacking problems and keeps me from obsessing over a project for too long.
